           <strong><dt>What is a yurt?</dt> </strong> 
                <dd> Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.</dd>
            
            <strong><dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt> </strong> 
                <dd> Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>
            
            <strong><dt>What should I bring?</dt> </strong> 
                <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!</dd>
